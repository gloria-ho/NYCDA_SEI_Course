In the first week of SEI we learned HTML and CSS. It was <span class="adjective1">(adjective1)</span> and <span class="adjective2">(adjective2)</span>. From there we had an instructor named Neil, he was really <span class="adjective2">(adjective2)</span>. I really enjoyed learning <span class="subject">(subject)</span>.
