Select styles are below. Approximate box model values as best as you can.

Three Google Fonts are being used:
"Source Sans Pro"
"Merriweather"
"Oswald"

body
font-family: "Source Sans Pro"

logo, tagline (two brains are better...), actions (Create a Profile; Find a Developer; Find a Designer)
font-family: "Merriweather", serif;

tagline
background-color: #C6C6C6;

tagline, crossed out text
color: #808080;

actions
background-color: #ededed;

Meet your Match!
font-family: "Oswald"

Nav Links
font-family: "Oswald";

Buttons
font-family: "Oswald";
background: #C6C6C6;

Create a Profile button
background-color: yellow;

Notes:
1) Set the image as a background CSS style (also look for background-position and backround-size)
2) To round the button's corners, look up the border-radius CSS property
3) To create the shadow for the buttons, look up box-shadow
4) Use the "rgba" color value to set the see-thru background of the "Meet your Match" element

Bonus:

When you have finished, copy your solution into a new folder called 'startup-matchmaker-flexbox'. Instead of using SimpleGrid, I'd like you to try using a built in CSS tool called flexbox.
